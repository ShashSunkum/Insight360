## 2. Questions and Problems We Aim to Solve

### Question 1: Which player attributes have the most significant impact on a player's market value?

**Value:** Football clubs often face challenges in accurately assessing a player's true market worth, leading to costly transfer mistakes or missed opportunities with undervalued talent. By pinpointing the key attributes that drive market value, our tool enables clubs to make data-informed transfer decisions, ensuring optimal investment and maximizing return on investment (ROI) for each signing.

### Question 2: What combinations of player attributes contribute to a higher win probability for teams?

**Value:** Coaches and analysts can utilize these insights to develop strategic game plans that align with their team's strengths. Understanding how specific attribute combinations—such as speed and passing accuracy for counter-attacking strategies—influence match outcomes allows teams to craft tactics that outperform opponents, leading to improved results on the pitch.

### Question 3: How do player performances vary across different geographical regions and leagues?

**Value:** By analyzing performance variations based on regions and leagues, scouting departments can identify emerging talent in underrepresented areas. This expands the scouting network efficiently, uncovering high-potential players who offer excellent value for money. Clubs can gain a competitive advantage by tapping into these untapped talent pools before their rivals.

- **Metadata:** Player nationality, club affiliation, league participation, age, and historical performance trends.

*Relevance:* This rich dataset provides a robust foundation for our analytical models and visualizations. It allows us to explore intricate relationships between player attributes and market value, assess performance across different leagues, and identify patterns that can inform strategic decision-making.
